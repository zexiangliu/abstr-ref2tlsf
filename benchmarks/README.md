There are three TLSF benchmarks converted from examples of ARCS. Please refers to the [pdf file](/doc/TLSF_Examples_of_Abstraction_based_Control.pdf) for detailed descriptions.

There TLSF benchmarks can be further converted to other formats by [syfco](https://github.com/reactive-systems/syfco). If you find that these examples are too complicated to be processed by tools like syfco, there are simplified versions of TLSF files located in [simplified version](simplified_version).
