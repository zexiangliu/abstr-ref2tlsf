There are three TLSF benchmarks converted from examples of ARCS. Please refers to the [pdf file](/doc/TLSF_Examples_of_Abstraction_based_Control.pdf) for detailed descriptions.

These TLSF benchmarks can be further converted to other formats by [syfco](https://github.com/reactive-systems/syfco). 

If you find that it is too slow for tools like syfco to process these TLSFs, there are simplified TLSFs for these examples located in folder [simplified version](simplified_version). Some time testing results for the simplified TLSFs are also included.
