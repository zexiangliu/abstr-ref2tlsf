There are three TLSF benchmarks converted from examples of ARCS. Please refers to the [pdf file]("/doc/TLSF Examples of Abstraction based Control.pdf") for detailed descriptions.

There TLSF benchmarks can be further converted to other formats by [syfco](https://github.com/reactive-systems/syfco). If you find that there examples are too complicated to be processed by tools like syfco, there are simplified version of the examples located in [simplified version]("simplified version").
